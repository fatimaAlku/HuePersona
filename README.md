## Inspiration

HuePersona is inspired by Korean color analysis tests that connect personality traits to color preferences â€” a playful blend of psychology and visual identity. Built with a full-stack MVC architecture, it showcases how structure can fuel creativity: Mongoose models handle rich user and color data, React-based views bring the experience to life, and controllers orchestrate the flow. By combining cultural insight with modern web development patterns, HuePersona turns personal expression into an interactive, self-discovery journey.
